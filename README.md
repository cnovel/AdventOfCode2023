# Advent of Code 2023 🎄
Back to Python for simplicity this year (having a kid makes it harder to find time to code!).
Nonetheless, some goals for this year edition:
 * More regex! Too many times I have found my way around by splitting strings with token. This year is the year I master the Regex! 💪
 * Better code organization! Usage of classes in order to avoid duplicate code between each day. 🗃️
